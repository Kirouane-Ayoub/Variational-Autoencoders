A particular class of neural network called an autoencoder is made to learn effective ways to represent input data. They are made up of an encoder that maps the input data to a latent space and a decoder that reverses the mapping. In order to reduce the discrepancy between the input data and the reconstructed data, the encoder and decoder are often trained together.
The issue of feature engineering, or the act of manually choosing and modifying input features to enhance the performance of a machine-learning model, was addressed by the development of autoencoders. Due to the need for domain expertise and the potential for engineer bias, feature engineering can be time-consuming and error-prone. In order to automate the feature engineering process, autoencoders were created, which learn effective representations of the input data straight from the data.
